# Hello World, I'm Tareq Abu El Komboz 👋

I am a **Computer Science Master's student** at the **University of Stuttgart** and a **Working Student at Porsche AG**. My work focuses on the intersection of **Reinforcement Learning**, **Deep Learning** and **Large Language Models**. I am currently preparing for a PhD starting in 2026, aiming to contribute to the next generation of Intelligent Systems.

### 🔬 Research Focus
* **Master's Thesis:** Investigating **Anomaly Detection** in vehicle control units using **LogBERT** and **LogLLM** in cooperation with **Porsche AG**
  * Demonstrated that scaling models from **1B to 8B parameters** significantly improves **F1-scores** (e.g., from 0.419 to 0.912 on the BGL dataset)
* **Bachelor's Thesis:** Developed a **Learn-to-Optimize** framework using **RL (PPO, REINFORCE)** to solve parameter-dependent black-box problems
  * Demonstrated agent generalization to unseen parameter configurations in up to 10 dimensions
* **Anomaly Detection:** Achieved a **93% F1-score** in Credit Card Fraud Detection using **OC-NN**, outperforming standard kNN baselines
* **Study Project:** Automated Clustering of Small Molecules 

### 🛠️ Work Experience
* **Porsche AG (Working Student - AI/LLM):** Currently automating test case generation from hardware requirements using **LLMs**
* **Porsche AG (Data Science Intern):** Applied **Association Rule Discovery** to correlate customer complaints with ECU faults
* **Teaching Assistant:** Led tutorials for **60+ students** in **Data Structures and Algorithms** and **Theoretical CS**

### 💻 Technical Expertise
* **Reinforcement Learning:** PPO, SAC, DQN, MCTS, DynaQ+, Policy Gradients, (PO)MDPs
* **Deep Learning:** Transformers (LLMs), Diffusion Models, GANs, Autoencoders, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs
* **Core Stack:** Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, CUDA, Hugging Face, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

### 🏆 Achievements & Certificates
* **Scholarships:** Recipient of the **Baden-Württemberg Scholarship** for a semester abroad at the **University of Adelaide**
* **Awards:** Winner of the **Business Model Award** for "VectisFinance" in **AI Incubator Batch #3**
* **Specializations:** **Certificate of Advanced Studies (18 ECTS)** in AI and Software Engineering via the **AI Software Academy (AISA)**
* **Programs** Completed **AI Career Kickstart Program**, Training on interdisciplinary topics like "ML Operations", "AI Regulations" and "ML Organizational Roles"

### 🥊 Beyond the Code
I am passionate about **Strategy Games:** Chess, Xiangqi, and Go.
