# Hi there, I'm Tareq Abu El Komboz 👋

I am a **Computer Science Master's student** at the **University of Stuttgart** and a **Working Student at Porsche AG**. My work focuses on the intersection of **Reinforcement Learning**, **Deep Learning** and **Large Language Models**. I am currently preparing for a PhD starting in 2026, aiming to contribute to the next generation of Intelligent Systems.

### 🔬 Research Focus
* **Master's Thesis:** Investigating **Anomaly Detection** in vehicle control units using **LogBERT** and **LogLLM** in cooperation with **Porsche AG**.
* Demonstrated that scaling models from **1B to 8B parameters** significantly improves **F1-scores** (e.g., from 0.419 to 0.912 on the BGL dataset).
* **Bachelor's Thesis:** Developed a **Learn-to-Optimize** framework using **RL (PPO, REINFORCE)** to solve parameter-dependent black-box problems.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Achieved a **93% F1-score** in Credit Card Fraud Detection using **OC-NN**, outperforming standard kNN baselines.

### 🛠️ Industry Experience
* **Porsche AG (Working Student - AI/LLM):** Currently automating test case generation from hardware requirements using **LLMs** and **AWS**.
* **Porsche AG (Data Science Intern):** Applied **Association Rule Discovery** to correlate customer complaints with ECU faults.
* **Teaching Assistant:** Led tutorials for **60+ students** in **Data Structures and Algorithms** and **Theoretical CS**.

### 💻 Technical Expertise
* **Deep Learning:** Transformers (LLMs), Diffusion Models, GANs, GNNs, CNNs.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** PPO, SAC, DQN, MCTS, DynaQ+, Policy Gradients.
* **Core Stack:** Python, PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, CUDA, Hugging Face, Scikit-learn.

### 🏆 Achievements & Certificates
* **Academic Excellence:** M.Sc. Current Grade: **1.3** | B.Sc. Final Grade: **1.9**.
* **Scholarships:** Recipient of the **Baden-Württemberg Scholarship** for a semester abroad at the **University of Adelaide**.
* **Awards:** Winner of the **AI Incubator Batch #3** and the **Business Model Award** for "VectisFinance".
* **Specializations:** **Certificate of Advanced Studies (18 ECTS)** in AI and Software Engineering via the **AI Software Academy (AISA)**.

### 🥊 Beyond the Code
I am passionate about **Strategy Games:** Chess, Xiangqi, and Go.
