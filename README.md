## Hello World, I'm Tareq Abu El Komboz 👋

**M.Sc. Computer Science Student / Incoming PhD Applicant / RL Researcher**

I am a Master’s student at the [**University of Stuttgart**](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) (Focus: Intelligent Systems, Grade: 1.3) and a Working Student at [**Porsche AG**](https://www.porsche.com/germany/). My work sits at the intersection of **Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, specifically focused on making autonomous systems more reliable and interpretable.

🎯 **Goal:** Currently applying for a **PhD starting in 2026**, aiming to contribute to **[ICML](https://icml.cc/), [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/), and [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/)**.

### 🔬 Research Interests
* **Reinforcement Learning:** Generalization in "Learn-to-Optimize" frameworks and high-dimensional black-box optimization .
* **ML Systems:** Automating verification and validation pipelines in safety-critical automotive environments.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Scaling LLMs ([LogBERT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534113&casa_token=H2aht8F-SpoAAAAA:ywVzfH12u-6K_s9DdFFz4Jd0YcPR_ae1T8me3iFBbH4X2Jvva1MJqc8e07E7NXYtW4pvbBi_Yw&tag=1)/[LogLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08561)) for zero-shot and few-shot fault detection in complex trace files.

### 🚀 Featured Work
* **Master's Thesis ([Porsche AG](https://www.porsche.com/germany/)):** *Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection in Vehicle Control Units.*
    * Adapted **LogBERT** and **LogLLM** for real-world automotive telemetry.
    * Demonstrated that scaling from **1B to 8B parameters** yields a **~117% improvement** in F1-score (0.419 → 0.912) on the BGL dataset.
* **Bachelor's Thesis:** [*Parameter-Dependent Self-Learning Optimization.*](https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/items/120c5c5b-47e9-4f0a-a664-8c9a46631a59)
    * Developed an RL-based optimizer using [**PPO**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347)/[**REINFORCE**](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00992696.pdf) that generalizes to unseen parameter configurations in 10D space, outperforming static state-of-the-art baselines.

### 🥊 Beyond the Code
I'm a practitioner of **Strategy Games**—Chess, Xiangqi, and Go. I find the algorithmic parallels between MCTS in AlphaZero and human strategic intuition fascinating.
