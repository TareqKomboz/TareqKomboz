# Hello World, I'm Tareq Abu El Komboz 👋

**Computer Science Researcher | Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning**

I am a Master’s student at the **University of Stuttgart** (Focus: Intelligent Systems, Grade: 1.3) and a Working Student at **Porsche AG**. My work sits at the intersection of **Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, specifically focused on making autonomous systems more reliable and interpretable.

🎯 **Goal:** Currently preparing for a **PhD starting in 2026**, aiming to contribute to **ICML, ICLR, and NeurIPS**.

### 🔬 Research Interests
* **Anomaly Detection:** Scaling LLMs (LogBERT/LogLLM) for zero-shot and few-shot fault detection in complex trace files.
* **Reinforcement Learning:** Generalization in "Learn-to-Optimize" frameworks and high-dimensional black-box optimization.
* **ML Systems:** Automating verification and validation pipelines in safety-critical automotive environments.

### 🚀 Featured Work
* **Master's Thesis (Porsche AG):** *Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection in Vehicle Control Units.* * Adapted **LogBERT** and **LogLLM** for real-world automotive telemetry.
    * Demonstrated that scaling from **1B to 8B parameters** yields a **~117% improvement** in F1-score (0.419 → 0.912) on the BGL dataset.
* **Bachelor's Thesis:** *Parameter-Dependent Self-Learning Optimization.*
    * Developed an RL-based optimizer using **PPO** that generalizes to unseen parameter configurations in 10D space, outperforming static state-of-the-art baselines.

### 🥊 Beyond the Code
I'm a practitioner of **Strategy Games**—Chess, Xiangqi, and Go. I find the algorithmic parallels between MCTS in AlphaZero and human strategic intuition fascinating.
